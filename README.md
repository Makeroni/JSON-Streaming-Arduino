RGB led using Arduino and JSON remote streaming
===============================================


Emitter
-------

PHP script that streams JSON elements:

```
{ "id" :   1, "value" : 128 },
{ "id" :   2, "value" : 243 },
{ "id" :   3, "value" :  31 },
{ "id" :   1, "value" : 140 },
{ "id" :   2, "value" : 237 },
{ "id" :   3, "value" :  24 },
...
```

Field id represents the analog output to control with values ranging from 0 to 255. JSON elemements have same size for later parsing in Arduino.


Controller
----------

Arduino program that reads the remote JSON stream and controls an RGB led using three PWM signals. Data is also pass through serial port for later representation using Processing. Arduino was able to receive up to 10 rgb values per second.


Plotter
-------

Processing program that reads serial data from Arduino and plots.
